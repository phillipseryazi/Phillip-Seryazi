- An environmentalist app that provides useful information to farmers about what effect they are having on the environment especially by planting trees. The app calculates the amount of carbon each farmer takes out of the atmosphere by planting trees. The app also provides farmers with useful learning information on tree raring in the form of video and audio learning courses.
